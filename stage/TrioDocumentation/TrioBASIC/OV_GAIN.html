<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
The Output Velocity (OV) gain is a gain constant which is
multiplied by the change in measured position.  The result is summed with all
the other gain terms and applied to the servo DAC. Adding NEGATIVE output
velocity gain to a system is mechanically equivalent to adding damping. It is
likely to produce a smoother response and allow the use of a higher
proportional gain than could otherwise be used, but at the expense of higher
following errors. High values may lead to oscillation and produce high following
errors. For an output velocity term Kov and change in position DPm, the
contribution to the output signal is:
