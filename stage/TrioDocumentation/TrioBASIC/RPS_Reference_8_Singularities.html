<h1>Singularities</h1>
<p>
In a singular position, the end
effector cannot move in certain direction, thus the manipulator loses one or
more degrees of freedom (DOF). Furthermore, near singular configuration, some
axes can move to a very large speed to maintain constant end effector speed.
</p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>
In a 6 DOF robot arm, the most
common singular positions are described below.
</p>
<h3>Wrist Singularity</h3>
<p>
Wrist singularity occurs when the
wrist and the first orientation axis are collinear.

</p>
<h3>Elbow Singularity</h3>
<p>
Elbow singularity occurs when the
arm is fully extended.

<h3>Alignment Singularity</h3>
<p>
Alignment singularity occurs when
the wrist and the base are aligned.

</p>
<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>
When a singular position is
reached or is close enough and the system is not in joint mode, a ROBOTSTATUS
error will be triggered by the relevant axis and the robot will stop at the
configured WORLD_FASTDEC.
</p>
<p class="note">
To leave the singular position, the
system must be in joint mode.
