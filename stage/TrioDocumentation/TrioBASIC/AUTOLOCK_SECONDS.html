<h1>AUTOLOCK_SECONDS</h1>
<h2>Type:</h2>
<p class="Category">
System Command (MC_CONFIG only)
</p>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<p class="fixed">
AUTOLOCK_SECONDS = value
</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
The AUTOLOCK_SECONDS command is designed to automatically
lock the controller following a disconnection with Motion Perfect, either when
a certain amount of time elapsed, or immediately after the ethernet connection
to Motion Perfect is disrupted. 
</p>
<p>
This command can be activated within MC_CONFIG to enable the
feature immediately on start-up, or later, either in a program or via the
command line.
</p>
<p>
When a 
<i>Motion Coordinator</i> is locked, it is not
possible to view, edit or save any programs and command line instructions are
limited to those required to execute the program.
</p>
<p class="tip">
This feature is initiated once it is locked via Motion Perfect. 
</p>
<p class="tip">
You should use Motion Perfect to LOCK and UNLOCK your controller.
</p>
<p class="tip">
Once locked, controller will remain locked following a power
cycle.
</p>
<p>
To unlock the controller, the UNLOCK command should be
entered using the same lock code number which was used originally to LOCK it.
</p>
<p>
The lock code number may be any integer and is held in
encoded form. Once LOCKed, the only way to gain full access to the 
<i>Motion
Coordinator</i> is to 
<a href="UNLOCK.html">UNLOCK</a>
 it with the correct
code.  For best security the lock number should be 7 digits. 
</p>
<p class="note">
 Limitation on Flex6-Nano for immediate lock mechanism on
ethernet disruption. This feature is currently not implemented on Flex6-Nano.
