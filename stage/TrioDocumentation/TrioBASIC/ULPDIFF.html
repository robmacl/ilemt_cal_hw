<h1>ULPDIFF</h1>
<h2>Type:</h2>
<p class="Category">
Mathematical Function
</p>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<p class="fixed">
value = ULPDIFF(expression-1, expression-2)
</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
Returns the difference between two floating-point values in
terms of units in the last place (ULP).
</p>
<p>
A floating-point value can be viewed as being an integer
(the significand, or mantissa) with a scaling (the exponent), so altering the
least significant bit of the significand by one will create a floating-point
value that is one unit in the last place (or unit of least precision)
different, which is the smallest difference possible.
</p>
<p>
This function provides a measure of how many units in the
last place need to be added to one value to get to the other value, which is
like a measure of how many values exist between the two supplied values (plus
one). This can be useful when comparing floating-point values to determine how
close they are to each other (how nearly equal they are).
</p>
<p>
This concept is best illustrated by an example, so if we had
a simplified fixed-point number system where the smallest fraction was
one-tenth, then the ULP difference between 12.6 and 12.6 is 0, and between 12.6
and 12.7 is 1, and between 12.6 and 13.1 is 5, and so on.
</p>
<p>
The number system used on Trio controllers is more complex
than this simplified system, utilising the double precision IEEE 754 standard,
which is a floating-point format, so an ULP difference of 1 between two values
can be either exceptionally small in absolute terms when the exponent is small,
or exceptionally large when the exponent is large, and this is because the ULP
is part of the significand and so is scaled by the exponent.
