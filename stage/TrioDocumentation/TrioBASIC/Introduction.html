<h1>TrioBASIC</h1>
<p>
TrioBASIC is multi-tasking programming language used by the Trio
multitasking Motion Coordinator range of programmable motion controllers. The
syntax is like that of other BASIC family languages. A PC running the Microsoft
Windows™ operating system is used to develop and test the application programs
which coordinate all the required motion and machine functions using Trio’s 
<i>Motion</i>
Perfect software. 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect provides all editing and debugging
functionality needed to write and debug applications written in TrioBASIC. The
completed application does not require the PC to run.
