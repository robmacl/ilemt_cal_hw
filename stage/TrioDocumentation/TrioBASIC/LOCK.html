<h1>LOCK</h1>
<h2>Type:</h2>
<p class="Category">
System Command (command line only)
</p>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<p class="fixed">
LOCK(code)
</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
The 
<a href="LOCK.html">LOCK</a>
 copmmand is designed to
prevent programs from being viewed or modified by personnel unaware of the
security code. The lock code number is stored in the flash EPROM.
</p>
<p>
When a 
<i>Motion Coordinator</i> is locked, it is not
possible to view, edit or save any programs and command line instructions are
limited to those required to execute the program. The 
<a href="CONTROL.html">CONTROL</a>

value has 1000 added to it when the controller is LOCKed.
</p>
<p class="tip">
You should use Motion Perfect to LOCK and UNLOCK your controller.
</p>
<p>
To unlock the 
<i>Motion Coordinator</i>, the UNLOCK command
should be entered using the same lock code number which was used originally to LOCK
it.
</p>
<p>
The lock code number may be any integer and is held in
encoded form. Once LOCKed, the only way to gain full access to the 
<i>Motion
Coordinator</i> is to 
<a href="UNLOCK.html">UNLOCK</a>
 it with the correct
code.  For best security the lock number should be 7 digits.   
</p>
<p class="warning">
It is possible to compromise the security of the lock system.
Users must consider if the level of security is sufficient to protect their
programs. If you want better security consider encrypting your project.
</p>
<p class="note">
If you forget the security code number, the Motion Coordinator
may have to be returned to your supplier to be unlocked.
