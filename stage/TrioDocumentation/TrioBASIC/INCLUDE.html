<h1>INCLUDE</h1>
<h2>Type:</h2>
<p class="Category">
System Command.
</p>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<p class="fixed">
INCLUDE &quot;filename&quot;
</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
Allows the inclusion of TrioBASIC commands and constructs
(except ON BASICERROR). This is typically used to share data initialisation
between programs, but you can imagine an INCLUDE as a copy and paste from the
include into the program at the point of the INCLUDE statement, but with the
benefit that any changes made to the included file are shared between all
programs that include it.
</p>
<p class="note">
Whenever an included program is modified, all programs that
depend on it are re-compiled as well, avoiding inconsistencies.
</p>
<p class="note">
Note that prior to firmware version 2.0269:

<p class="note" style="margin-left:57.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Symbol">&bull;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Nested includes were not allowed (now they are allowed to be up
to 5 deep)
</p>
<p class="note" style="margin-left:57.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Symbol">&bull;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Includes had to be the first statement (barring comments) in a
program (now they may be placed anywhere)
</p>
<p class="note" style="margin-left:57.25pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
<span style="font-family:Symbol">&bull;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Only variable definitions and conditional logic were allowed, and
it could not be used as a general subroutine with any commands within it (it
may now contain any statements)
</p>
<p class="note">
Circular dependency is not permitted. So, A cannot include
itself; if A includes B, B cannot include A; if A includes B and B Includes C,
C cannot include either B or A, etc.
