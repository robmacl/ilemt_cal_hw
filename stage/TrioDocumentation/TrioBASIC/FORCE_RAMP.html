<h1>FORCE_RAMP</h1>
<h2>Type:</h2>
<p class="Category">
Axis Parameter 
</p>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<p class="codeexample">
FORCE_RAMP AXIS(n) = &lt;value&gt;
</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
FORCE_RAMP programs a change to the FORCE_SPEED over the
length of the move and can be applied to advanced speed control moves (those
suffixed with “SP”, like MOVESP, MOVEABSSP, MOVECIRCSP etc.).
</p>
<p>
The ramp is defined by the acceleration required to change
from one speed to another over the length of the move with an increasing speed
having a positive value and a decreasing speed a negative value. This is
calculated by determining the duration of the move (from the move’s distance
divided by the average speed (the sum of the initial and final speeds divided
by 2)), and the acceleration required is determined from the speed change over
the move divided by the duration just calculated.
</p>
<p class="note">
After setting a ramp for a move, it is necessary to set
FORCE_RAMP to zero before loading subsequent moves that do not require a ramp.
</p>
<p>
Since the way that this works is by constantly adjusting the
move’s FORCE_SPEED value, this will result in many small changes in speed, and
if using a VP_MODE that uses JERK, this will result in repeated application of
jerk all along the length of the move. If this is a problem, then the same
value that was assigned to FORCE_RAMP can be assigned to FORCE_ACCEL if the
ramp is increasing in speed or FORCE_DECEL if the ramp is decreasing in speed,
and the ENDMOVE_SPEED setting to the speed required, and this will result in a
single application of jerk to start the ramp and a single application of jerk
to end the ramp.

<h2>Value:</h2>
<p>
The acceleration required to change from one speed to the
next over the length of the move.
</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>
Suppose the ENDMOVE_SPEED of the previous move was 100 and it
is required that the next move programs a deceleration to 75 over the length of
the move:
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     start_sp = 100
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     end_sp = 75
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     dist = 1
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     t = dist * 2 / (start_sp + end_sp)
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     ramp = (end_sp - start_sp) / t
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     FORCE_SPEED = start_sp
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     ENDMOVE_SPEED = end_sp
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     FORCE_RAMP = ramp
</p>
<p class="codeexample">
     MOVESP(dist)
</p>
