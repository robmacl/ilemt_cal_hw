<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
The Robotic Programming System (RPS), is an adaptable
package of tools and software that offers a complete control and management of
a robot system, reducing programming and optimizing productivity. 
</p>
<p>
RPS is a language extension block dedicated for robotics
applications using Trio controllers that is based on TrioBasic. 
</p>
<p>
RPS improves the efficiency of your code and application by
reducing the number of lines in your programs. It matches perfectly with the
standard Trio Basic. 
</p>
<p>
RPS has a group of kinematics transformations, advanced
control algorithms deliver the possibility to program in one coordinate system
when the machine does not have a direct mechanical connection to his coordinate
system. Once RPS is set in the controller, a selected group of axes will be set
as a robot. 
</p>
<p>
To activate RPS in the controller, a configuration data to
specify the lengths of mechanical links, operating modes and other information
is required.
