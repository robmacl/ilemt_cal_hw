<h1>IP_BIND_ADDRESS</h1>
<h2>Type:</h2>
<p class="Category">
System Parameter
</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
IP_BIND_ADDRESS is used to set the Ethernet IPv4 UDP and
TCPSERVER bind address for client connections. By default, when a TrioBASIC
client connection is opened with the 
<a href="OPEN.html">OPEN</a>
 command, the
local socket is bound to the source IP address, 0.0.0.0. This is a synonym for
all current local IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
When a UDP or TCPSERVER client is created, the 
<a href="OPEN.html">OPEN</a>
 statement only specifies one port, which is used to
create both the source and destination sockets. If IP_BIND_ADDRESS is 0.0.0.0,
then we cannot talk to applications that are running on the same device. To
avoid this situation, we set IP_BIND_ADDRESS to a specific local IP address,
for example 127.0.0.1.
</p>
<p>
The default value is 0.0.0.0. 
</p>
<p class="note">
Note that this parameter is applicable to PC-MCAT only.
</p>
<h2>Value:</h2>
<p>
Network IP address in dot-decimal notation, which consists
of four decimal numbers separated by dots, where each number is an 8-bit value
(an octet), and so has the range 0 to 255.
</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<p class="codeexample">
IP_BIND_ADDRESS = 192.168.0.250
