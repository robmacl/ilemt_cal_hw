<h1>Diagnostics</h1>
<p>
<i>Motion</i> Perfect has some built-in diagnostics which
are designed to provide useful information in diagnosing some communications
problems and possibly problems with 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect functionality.
Diagnostic functions should not be used unless requested to do so by Trio
Motion Technology, as enabling diagnostics increases the load on the
application and can, in some cases, lead to unreliability.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt">
Diagnostic
functionality is accessed via a submenu of the Tools section of the Motion
Perfect main menu.

<p>
 When “Abs” is selected the raw ticks count for the Motion
Perfect command process on the controller is displayed. When “Rel” is selected
a relative ticks count is displayed, which can be set to zero using the “Zero”
button.
</p>
<p class="note">
The tool is used to provide regular, recognizable communications
data which can be used in communications debugging. Under normal circumstances
it is of little practical use.
