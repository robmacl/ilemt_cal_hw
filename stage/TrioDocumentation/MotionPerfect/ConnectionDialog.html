<h1>Connection Dialog</h1>
<p>
The connection dialog allows the user to configure a
communications interface in order to connect to a controller. Ethernet, Serial,
PCI and USB interfaces are supported by 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect. It is possible
to select a communications interface and configure it manually or choose from
recently used connections.
</p>

</p>
<h2>Recent Connections</h2>
<p>
To choose a recent connection, click on the
&quot;Recent&quot; button and choose a connection from the drop-down list.
</p>
<h2>Ethernet</h2>
<p>
<img width="399" height="295" id="Picture 1" src="ConnectionDialog_files/image002.png">
</p>
<p>
It is possible to give the connection a name, specify the
server IP address (IP address of the controller) and the IP port on which it
communicates.
</p>
<p class="note">
By default a controller will expect a connection from Motion
Perfect to be made on port 23.
</p>
<p>
The “Timeouts” button causes the “Timeouts” dialog to be
displayed.
</p>
<h3>Timeouts Dialog</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The “Timeouts” dialog allows the user to change the timeouts
used for communication with the connected controller(s). Increasing the
timeouts may be necessary to communicate reliably with a controller over a
connection to a remote location.
</p>
<p class="note">
Increasing the timeouts will mean that Motion Perfect will take
longer to react if communication errors occur.
</p>
<h2>Serial</h2>
<p>
<img width="399" height="295" id="Picture 10" src="ConnectionDialog_files/image004.png">
</p>
<p>
It is possible to select the COM interface and the
configuration (serial link parameters) from a choice of Slow (9600,e,7,2) and
Fast (38400,e,8,1), these being the default settings for series 2 &amp; 3 Trio 
<i>Motion</i>
Coordinators.
</p>
<h2>PCI</h2>
<p>
<img width="399" height="295" id="Picture 11" src="ConnectionDialog_files/image005.png">
</p>
<p>
It is possible to select the board number. Board numbers are
allocated when the PC is started up and is enumerated between 0 and the one
less than the number of Trio PCI cards connected.
</p>
<h2>USB</h2>
<p>
<img width="399" height="295" id="Picture 13" src="ConnectionDialog_files/image006.png">
</p>
<p>
It is possible to select the device number. Device numbers
are allocated when the PC is started up and when devices are added or removed.
It is normally enumerated between 0 and the one less than the number of Trio USB
devices connected. Because of the nature of the internal scanning process which
enumerates USB devices and the possibility that devices are added or removed
after the initial scan has completed, a given device may not always have the
same device number.
</p>
<p class="warning">
It is recommended that only one Trio USB device be connected
to a PC at any one time as the order in which the system enumerates more than
one device cannot be guaranteed.
</p>
<h2>Simulator</h2>
<p>
It is possible to run more than one instance of the
simulator on a single computer. When &quot;Simulator&quot; is selected in this
dialog the default simulator IP address is displayed in the dialog. If the
current connection is a simulator then that simulator's IP address is displayed
when the dialogue is first opened.
</p>
<p>
<img width="399" height="295" id="Picture 19" src="ConnectionDialog_files/image007.png">
</p>
<p>
To connect to a simulator at a different IP address to the
one displayed, click on the &quot;Simulator
&nbsp;
127.0.0.1&quot;
to display a connection settings dialog.
</p>
<p>
<img width="496" height="281" id="Picture 21" src="ConnectionDialog_files/image008.png">
</p>
<p>
Normally it will only be necessary to change the IP address
to that of the simulator to which you want to connect, or use “connect to a
running simulator” at the bottom of the dialog and then select from the list of
simulators displayed. If there are no simulators running, click on the “Manage
Simulators” button to display the “
<a href="SimulatorManager.html">Manage
Simulators</a>
” dialog.
