<h1>STARTUP Program</h1>
<p>
The STARTUP program is an automatically generated program
designed to be run at system start to initialize the system. The STARTUP
program is a standard TrioBASIC program which needs to be run as a user
specified auto-run program (unlike the MC_CONFIG program which always run at
power-up). The STARTUP program is divided into sections each section being
modified by a different tool (including some add-ons) in Motion Perfect.
</p>
<p class="note">
The STARTUP program should be modified using the special STARTUP
program generator (started by selecting “Project / Modify STARTUP Program …” 
from the Motion Perfect main menu).
</p>
<p class="warning">
Great care should be taken if the STARTUP program is edited
manually in the BASIC program editor as any changes may be lost or modified if
any of the tools in Motion Perfect edit it automatically. Editing it manually
is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
The file is divided up into sections each section being
generated by a different tool. Some plug-ins will generate a section in the
STARTUP file for the configuration of external devices (such as intelligent
drives).
