Lock / Unlock Controller</h1>
<p>
Locking the controller will prevent any unauthorised user
from viewing or modifying the programs in memory, and also prevent 
<i>Motion</i>
Perfect from connecting in Sync mode.
</p>
<h2>Locking</h2>
<p>
To Lock the currently connected controller, select
&quot;Controller / Lock Controller&quot; from the main menu. For this to be
available it must be enabled in the Options Dialog (“
<a href="#_Lock_/_Unlock">General
/ Miscellaneous</a>
” page) and Motion Perfect must be connected to the
controller in Sync mode.
</p>

</p>
<p>
In the &quot;Controller Lock&quot; dialog, enter a numeric
code (up to 7 digits) as a lock code. This value will be encoded by the system
and used to lock the directory structure. The lock code is held in encrypted
form in the flash memory of the controller.
</p>
<p class="warning">
If you forget the lock code there is no way to unlock the
controller. You will need to return it to Trio or a distributor to have the
lock removed.
</p>
<p>
When the controller is locked the controller icon in the
&quot;Controller Tree&quot; will have a lock symbol overlaid on it,

and the controller name in the &quot;Status Bar&quot; will
have a lock symbol next to it.

<h2>Unlocking</h2>
<p>
To Unlock the currently connected controller, select
&quot;Controller / Unlock Controller&quot; from the main menu (only available
when the controller is locked).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Enter the lock code with which the controller was previously
locked. After the lock code has been accepted full access to the contents of
the controller will be restored.
