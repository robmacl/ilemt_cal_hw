<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>
A 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect project contains a set of programs
and settings which represents the contents of the controller for a given
application. Al files relating to a project are stored in a single directory on
the PC this is known as the 
<b>project directory</b>.
</p>
<h2>Project Directory</h2>
<p>
The files contained in  the 
<b>project directory</b> will
depend on the programs used in the project. There are three main files in the 
<b>project
directory</b> which all have the same name as the project directory but have
different file extensions.
</p>
<h3>Project file (extension &quot;mpv3prj&quot;)</h3>
<p>
This contains a definition of the contents of the project
(programs) and any customization such as axis names.
</p>
<h3>Desktop File (extension &quot;mpv3dsk&quot;)</h3>
<p>
This contains the desktop layout used when 
<i>Motion</i>
Perfect is connected in sync mode to the controller.
</p>
<h3>Tool Internal Conditions (extension &quot;mpv3ic&quot;)</h3>
<p>
This contains the internal state of each open tool window
when 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect is connected in sync mode to the controller.
</p>
<h2>Program Files</h2>
<p>
Program files are also stored in the project directory. The
type of each file can be determined by its file extension the most notable
being .BAS which is used for Trio BASIC programs. Each program may also have a
.PRG file of the same name which specifies editor/debugger settings for the
program. 
</p>
<p>
Some complex types of program (usually handled by an add-in)
can have sub-directories which contain their data as well as one or more files
in the project directory. When this type of complex program is stored on the
controller it is stored as a single compressed archive file.
</p>
<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>
There is a &quot;Backup&quot; sub-directory in which backups
of the project are stored.
</p>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p class="warning">
Although many of the files which form part of the project are
text files the user should not edit them directly using a text editor as this
may cause compatibility problems between the project and the controller. All
changes should be made using  Motion Perfect.
