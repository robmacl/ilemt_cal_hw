<h1>Global Targets</h1>
<p>
In association with robot related
development, a new TARGET data type has been introduced in the Trio BASIC
language. It stores information of position and orientation in 3D space. The TARGET
data type represents a set of 6 values:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>X, Y, Z – for the coordinates of the point in 3D
space in millimeters
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>U, V, W – for the angular orientation in
degrees.
</p>
<p>
An array of 1000 global target 
(
<a href="Glossary.html#GTA">GTA</a>
) 
points is available for use in
all programs. In addition to the 6 coordinates GTAs can have name assigned
which can be used to reference them in programs. An Active state flag used to
determine whether 
<a href="Glossary.html#GTA">GTA</a>
 point has already been defined and contains valid data.
</p>
<p>
The Robot tool displays a list of already
defined points. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The ranges of empty entries can be
collapsed to single line which allows for more compact representation.
</p>
<p>
To expand the empty ranges use ‘Show empty
entries’ check-box.
</p>
<h2>Adding A New Point</h2>
<p>
There are two methods for entering new
points – teaching and typing-in.
</p>
<p>
<img border="0" width="242" height="101" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image002.png">
</p>
<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>
This method makes use of robot jog tool to
interactively adjust the robot position and orientation before acquired point
to be stored.
</p>
<p>
<img border="0" width="599" height="472" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image003.png">
</p>
<p>
Once the operator has finished adjusting
the robot to the target position it can be added to the list by pressing ‘Teach
point’ button.
</p>
<p>
A dialog box is displayed allowing the
operator to set the name for the new 
<a href="Glossary.html#GTA">GTA</a>
 point and also to do any corrections
to the coordinates if necessary. The name should be different from the existing
ones otherwise the tool will refuse to add the new point.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<img border="0" width="198" height="199" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image004.png">
</p>
<p>
Pressing the ‘Append’ button adds the new point
to the list.
</p>
<p>
 Jog will not close automatically after
appending the point, allowing the operator to add multiple target points in a single
teach session. The software will automatically select the next empty position
in the list.
</p>
<h3>Typing-in </h3>
<p>
In this mode the operator directly enters
the name and the coordinates of the target point.
</p>
<p>
<img border="0" width="233" height="288" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image005.png">
</p>
<p>
The user interface is similar to the final
stage in the teaching case. The coordinates can be entered manually or
populated by pressing the ‘Teach…’ button which will open robot jog tool.
</p>
<p>
Pressing ‘Append’ button will store the
newly entered data in the currently selected entry and software will move the
selection to the next empty entry.
</p>
<h2>Modifying An Existing Point</h2>
<p>
By pressing 
<img border="0" width="29" height="26" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image006.png">
 button a mode similar to the operation of ‘Type-in’ mode is
invoked. It allows the operator to modify coordinates or the name of previously
defined point or alternatively populate a new entry.
</p>
<p>
<img border="0" width="216" height="290" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image007.png">
</p>
<p>
After pressing ‘Apply’ button the
modifications are accepted and dialogue box is closed allowing only the modification
of a single entry at a time.
</p>
<h2>Moving Points</h2>
<p>
By pressing 
<img border="0" width="20" height="14" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image008.png">
 and 
<img border="0" width="19" height="14" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image009.png">
 buttons
currently selected points can be moved up or down on position in the list. When
empty entries are collapsed the selected points are moved over the entire
range.
</p>
<h2>Deleting Points</h2>
<p>
By pressing 
<img border="0" width="25" height="25" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image010.png">
button the data stored in selected points will be deleted and they
will become empty.
</p>
<h2>Move to Point</h2>
<p>
The user interface in that section allows
the operator to move the robot to the currently selected GTA point.
</p>
<p>
By pressing 
<img border="0" width="31" height="23" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image011.png">
 button the movement is started. 
</p>
<p>
It can be prematurely stopped by pressing 
<img border="0" width="30" height="28" src="RobotTool_GTA_files/image012.png">
 button.
</p>
<p>
The robot can be moved in two modes:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>linear – done by executing MOVEL command in
which case the motion of all joints is synchronized in order to produce linear
movement of the end effector of the robot
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>joint – done by executing MOVEJ command in which
case the each joint moves with constant speed between its start and end
position. In that mode the end effector is not guaranteed to move linearly
between its start and end position.
</p>
<p>
The speed of the movement can be adjusted
to be a fraction of the nominal speed provided as part of the robot definition.
</p>
<p>
In case of multi-robot configuration it is
possible to select the active robot which will be moved to the selected target
position.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to select active tool,
object frame and robot frame against which the movement will be applied.
</p>
<p>
These selections can be done using the
controls in right side of the title bar.
