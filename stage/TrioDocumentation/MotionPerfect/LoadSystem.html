<h1>Load System Firmware</h1>
<p>
<a name="Load_System"></a>
<i>Motion Coordinator</i>s feature
a flash EPROM for storage of both user programs and the system firmware. Using 
<i>Motion
</i>Perfect  it is possible to upgrade the system firmware to a newer version
using a system file supplied by Trio. 
</p>
<p class="note">
We do not advise that you load a new version of the system firmware
unless you are specifically advised to do so by your distributor or by Trio. 
</p>
<p class="warning">
The process of loading new system firmware will erase all
programs stored on the controller. So make sure that they are backed up (in a
project on the PC) before starting.
</p>
<p>
When you select the &quot;Load Firmware&quot; option from
the controller menu, you will be presented with a wizard type interface showing
a warning page.
</p>
<p>
If you have a memory card in the controller the first
warning page will suggest that you remove it as unless you are doing it for a
specific reason, the settings stored on the memory card may cause problems
after the firmware has been upgraded and could prevent 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect
from reconnecting to the controller.
</p>
<p>

<p>
You will then be shown a warning page regarding disabling
devices connected to the controller and advising that you should make sure that
your project has been saved as the upgrade process will erase all programs from
the controller.

You must ensure that you load only software designed for
your specific controller, other versions will not work and will probably make
the controller unusable.

Downloading may take several minutes, depending on the speed
of your PC, the controller and the communications link being used. During the
download, you should see the names of each section displayed in the 
<a href="OutputWindow.html">Output Window</a>
 as they are loaded.
</p>
<p>
When the download is complete, a checksum check is performed
to ensure that the download process was successful. If it passes the check you
will be presented with a confirmation screen and asked if you wish to store the
firmware into EPROM.
