<h1>Go To Window</h1>
<p>
This tool can be used to easily navigate to a specified line
number in current Trio BASIC editor, a label definition, a variable defined
with a DIM statement or a function definition.
</p>
<p>
The window operates in three modes : Labels, Variables and
Functions.
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
Labels
</li>


</ul>
<p style="margin-left:18.0pt">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

In this mode, the window acts on the active Trio BASIC
editor and lists all labels defined in the editor. 
To navigate
to a label simply double-click on it in the list box or select it and click on
the “Go!” button.
</p>
<ul type="disc">

</ul>

</p>
<p>
In this mode, the window acts on the active
Trio BASIC editor and lists all variables defined in the editor with a “DIM”
statement. It also lists all function arguments, in case the edited Trio BASIC
program is a Trio BASIC library.
</p>
<p>
To navigate to a variable definition simply
double-click on it in the list box or select it and click on the “Go!” button.
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
Functions

</ul>
<p style="margin-left:18.0pt">

<p>
<img width="373" height="545" src="GoTo_files/image003.png">
</p>
<p>
In this mode, the window displays a list of
all functions in all Trio BASIC libraries from 
<i>Motion Perfect</i>’s project.
</p>
<p>
To navigate to a function definition simply
double-click on it in the list box or select it and click on the “Go!” button.
</p>
<h2>Navigating to a line</h2>
<p>
In all modes the text box at the bottom can
be used to type in a desired line number. Pressing the “Enter” key on the
keyboard or clicking on the “Go!” button will navigate to the specified line
number in the active Trio BASIC editor.
</p>
<h2>Automatically closing the tool</h2>
<p>
Sometimes the tool might be needed just to
quickly navigate to a line number, label, variable or function. It allows to be
automatically closed when navigating to the specified target by selecting
“Close Tool and Go!” option on 
„
Go!”
button.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This option can be selected by clicking on
the small arrow on the right of the button. The option is remembered the next
time the tool is open. The original mode can be restored again by clicking on
the arrow and selecting the default “Go!” mode.
</p>
<p>
When in “Close Tool and Go!” mode,
double-clicking on an item in the list box also closes automatically the tool.
</p>
<p>
<span class="MsoIntenseEmphasis">Please note that this option
is available if the tool is floating. When the tool is docked, only the “Go!”
mode is available</span>.
</p>
<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>
In some situations there might be too many
labels, variables or functions and searching manually for a particular one can
be slow. The tool provides a quick filtering box where instead of a line
number, a filter text can be typed in. The tool then filters the contents of
the list box by matching the filter text and displays only items that contain
the typed in text.
