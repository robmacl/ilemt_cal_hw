<p>
<img width="659" height="600" id="Picture 1" src="Options_General-Misc_files/image001.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Options are available for the following:
</p>
<h2>Cache Static Controller Data Locally</h2>
<p>
Controller Static Data is data stored on the controller
which tells 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect about the controller and its capabilities. If
this is not set then 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect will have to read the data each time
it connects to a controller. Caching is done when connecting in Tool or Sync
modes and a set of data for each controller with each version of firmware is
cached.
</p>
<p>
The “Clean Cached Data” button can be used to clear out all
the cached data. This may need to be done if the cached data gets corrupted or
a controller with development firmware is used.
</p>
<p class="tip">
It is recommended that caching is enabled.
</p>
<h2>Display numbers in tools in neutral format</h2>
<p>
This controls how numbers are displayed. If the box is
checked then numbers are displayed using a fixed (USA type) format. Otherwise
numbers are displayed using the format set by the locale of the Windows
operating system. 
</p>
<p class="warning">
Using the Windows locale setting may cause problems in some
tools.
</p>
<h2>Display Message when resetting desktop layout</h2>
<p>
If this box is checked then a warning message will be
displayed if the user tries to reset the desktop layout.
</p>
<h2>Display help in separate process</h2>
<p>
If this box is checked then the help file display
application is run in a separate process. Doing this decreases the chance of
unwanted interactions with the main application which can slow it down or, in
rare cases cause hang-ups at the expense of increasing the time taken to
display the help.
</p>
<p class="tip">
It is recommended that this is enabled.
</p>
<h2>Display help always on top</h2>
<p>
Checking this box keeps the help file displayed on top of
the application.
</p>
<h2>Enable controller lock tool</h2>
<p>
Checking this box allows the user to use the “Lock
Controller” tool. This is disabled by default so as to reduce the chances of a
user accidentally locking a controller.
</p>
<p class="tip">
Only enable this if you need to lock the controller with a lock
code.
</p>
<h2>Keep Output Window Open after Controller Reset.</h2>
<p>
If this is checked the output window will remain open during
a controller reset and hence capture the controller startup message.
</p>
<p class="tip">
It is recommended that this is enabled.
</p>
<h2>Auto-scale Graphical Content for non-100% DPI Settings</h2>
<p>
If this is checked and Windows is operating at a text
rendering setting of something other than 100% then the graphics used within 
<i>Motion</i>
Perfect will be scaled accordingly. This is of benefit using a very high
resolution display but can result in the graphics being rendered in a fuzzy,
indistinct way.
</p>
<p class="tip">
It is recommended that this is disabled unless you are using a
very high resolution display and have to use a scaling of greater than 150%.
</p>
<h2>Fractional Digits</h2>
<p>
This controls the number of decimal places used when displaying
real numbers.
