<h1>Generating a Project Key</h1>
<p>
The project key generation process involves 3 stages as
follows:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">

 
<li>
Enter the Project Password
</li>

 
<li>
Select the project key type
</li>

 
<li>
Entering the corresponding security code
</li>


</ol>
<h2>Project Password</h2>
<p>
The process starts with entering the same password, that is
used for project encryption. When a project has been encrypted already and the
project encryptor main window have not been yet closed, the last user password
is remembered for user's convenience.

</p>
<h2 style="margin-left:28.8pt;text-indent:-28.8pt">Selecting Project Key Type</h2>
<p>
There are three options available:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
using Controller Security Code
</li>

 
<li>
using User Security Code
</li>

 
<li>
using OEM Security Code
</li>


</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
When using Controller Security Code, the decryption
&quot;Project Key&quot; is derived from &quot;Project Password&quot; and Motion
Coordinator's unique security code. 
</p>
<p>
When using User Security Code, the decryption &quot;Project
Key&quot; is derived from &quot;Project Password&quot; and a custom
user-supplied User Security Code&quot;.
</p>
<p>
When using OEM Security Code, the decryption &quot;Project
Key&quot; is derived from &quot;Project Password&quot; and a custom
OEM-supplied security code.
</p>
<h2>Entering a security code</h2>
<p>
The next step is to generate a decryption &quot;Project
Key&quot; by entering a valid security code
</p>
<p>
When a valid security code is entered the corresponding
project key is generated automatically. Both the project key dialog in Motion
Perfect and the project encryptor main window have copy and paste buttons to
make transferring the number between the applications easier.
</p>

<h3>Using a Controller Security Code</h3>
<p>
<img width="600" height="400" id="Picture 9" src="ProjectEncryption-GenerateProjectKey_files/image003.jpg">
</p>
<p>
When started from within Motion Perfect, and Motion Perfect
is connected to a Motion Coordinator, the Controller Security Code will be
automatically filled in. Otherwise, the controller security code, or the user
security code, or the OEM security code, must be entered into the controller
security code text entry box.
</p>
<p>
The controller security code is a 15-digit numeric code
which is used to identify the Motion Coordinator and part of its hardware
configuration. This can be obtained from the Feature Enable tool in Motion
Perfect of from the project key dialog which Motion Perfect displays when an
encrypted project is specified for loading. Windows copy and paste can be used
to make the process easier.

<h3>Using a User Security Code</h3>
<p>
<img width="600" height="400" id="Picture 8" src="ProjectEncryption-GenerateProjectKey_files/image004.jpg">
</p>
<p>
When User Security Code feature is enabled on the Motion
Coordinator, users can set a custom security code, that is stored on the Motion
Coordinator. The same code should be used when generating the decryption
&quot;Project Key&quot;. When an encrypted project is loaded on the Motion
Coordinator, it is decrypted with the decryption &quot;Project Key&quot; that
is compared against the stored User Security Code on the Motion Coordinator.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Using an OEM Security Code</h3>
<p>
<img width="600" height="400" id="Picture 7" src="ProjectEncryption-GenerateProjectKey_files/image005.jpg">
</p>
<p>
When OEM Security Code feature is enabled on the Motion
Coordinator, equipment manufacturers can set a custom security code, that is
stored on the Motion Coordinator. The same code should be used when generating
the decryption &quot;Project Key&quot;. When an encrypted project is loaded on
the Motion Coordinator, it is decrypted with the decryption &quot;Project
Key&quot; that is compared against the stored OEM Security Code on the Motion
Coordinator.
