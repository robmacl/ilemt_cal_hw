<h1>EtherCAT Database Browser</h1>
<p>
The controller contains an internal
database of known EtherCAT devices. It is structured hierarchically by vendor
and then by device provided by a given vendor. For each device one or more
profiles are defined containing configuration information like:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
PDO configuration
</li>

 
<li>
SDO configuration
</li>

 
<li>
IO configuration
</li>


</ul>
<h2>List of Known Vendors and Products</h2>

each vendor, all known devices. For each vendor and device its name and unique
identification number is displayed in hexadecimal form. By double-clicking on
particular device a new window is displayed containing profile information.

<p>
Profile viewer display following configuration information
stored in selected profile:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
PDO configuration – parameters that are periodically
     exchanged between the controller and the device like status and control
     words. 
</li>

 
<li>
SDO configuration – parameters that are set during
     initialization of the device
</li>

 
<li>
IO configuration – information related to I/O
     configuration of the device
</li>


</ul>
<p>
If several profiles and/or control modes are supported by
given device then on the left side of the viewer a selection in form of
radio-buttons is displayed. The information on the right side of the viewer is
updated correspondingly when selecting other control mode or profile number.
</p>
<p>
Profile information in form of a report can be copied to the
clipboard or printed by pressing

<p>
Adding the selected combination of control
mode and profile number directly to the MC_CONFIG can be done by pressing “Add
to MC_CONFIG” button.

select the slave number on the EtherCAT bus to which the profile configuration will
be applied. It is also possible to enter a comment in order to improve
MC_CONFIG file readability. By pressing “Add to MC_CONFIG” button the selected
configuration is stored in the MC_CONFIG file.
