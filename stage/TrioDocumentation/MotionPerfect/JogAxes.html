<h1>Jog Axes</h1>
<p>
The Jog Axes tool allows the user to move the axes on the 
<i>Motion
</i>Coordinator. 
</p>
<p>
<img width="520" height="299" id="Picture 1" src="JogAxes_files/image001.png">
</p>
<p>
This tool takes advantage of the bi-directional I/O channels
on the 
<i>Motion </i>Coordinator to set the jog inputs. The forward, reverse
and fast jog inputs are identified by writing to the corresponding axis
parameters and are expected to be connected to NC switches. This means that
when the input is on (+24V applied) then the corresponding jog function is
DISABLED and when the input is off (0V) then the jog function is ENABLED. 
</p>
<p>
The jog functions implemented here disable the fast jog
function, which means that the speed at which the jog will be performed is set
by the 
<b>JOGSPEED</b> axis parameter. What is more this window limits the jog
speed to the range 0..demand_speed, where the demand_speed is given by the 
<b>SPEED</b>
axis parameter. 
</p>
<p>
Before allowing a jog to be initiated, the jog window checks
that all the data set in the jog window and on the 
<i>Motion </i>Coordinator is
valid for a jog to be performed. 
</p>
<p>
Each axis has a check box to enable/disable jogging on that
axis. This allows jogging to be configured on an axis but not actually used.
This is sometimes useful in machine development.
</p>

 Jog
Reverse </h2>
<p>
This button will initiate a reverse jog. In order to do
this, the following check sequence is performed: 
</p>
<ul style="list_style_type:disc">
<li class="indent-list-first">
If this is a SERVO or RESOLVER axis and the servo is off then set
the warning message 
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
If this axis has a daughter board and the Watchdog is off then
set the warning message 
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
If the jog speed is 0 the set the warning message 
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
If the acceleration rate on this axis is 0 then set the warning
message 
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
If the deceleration rate on this axis is 0 then set the warning
message 
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
If the reverse jog input is out of range then set the warning
message 
</li>
<li class="indent-list-last">
If there is already a move being performed on this axis that is
not a jog move then set the warning message 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If there were no warnings set, then the message
&quot;Reverse jog set on axis?&quot; is set in the warnings window, the 
<b>FAST_JOG</b>
input is invalidated for this axis, the 
<b>CREEP</b> is set to the value given
in the jog speed control and finally the 
<b>JOG_REV</b> output is turned off,
thus enabling the reverse jog function. 
</p>
<h2><img width="18" height="18" id="Picture 10" src="JogAxes_files/image003.png">
 Jog
Forward </h2>
<p>
This button will initiate a forward jog. In order to do
this, a check sequence identical to that used for 
<b>Jog Reverse</b> is
performed. 
</p>
<h2>Jog Speed </h2>
<p>
<img width="133" height="24" id="Picture 11" src="JogAxes_files/image004.png">
</p>
<p>
This is the speed at which the jog will be performed. This
window limits this value to the range from zero to the demand speed for this
axis, where the demand speed is given by the 
<b>SPEED</b> axis parameter. This
value can be changed by writing directly to this control or using the jog speed
control. The scroll bar changes the jog speed up or down in increments of 1
unit per second 
</p>
<h2>Jog Inputs </h2>
<p>
<img width="91" height="101" id="Picture 12" src="JogAxes_files/image005.png">
</p>
<p>
These are the inputs which will be associated with the
forward / reverse jog functions. 
</p>
<p>
They must be in the range 8 to the total number of inputs in
the system as the input channels 0 to 7 are not bi-directional and so the state
of the input cannot be set by the corresponding output. Both real and virtual
I/O lines can be used for jogging. The value -1 is shown when no input has been
allocated for jogging.
</p>
<p>
The jog function depends on the state of the jog inputs as
follows:

<h2>Warnings </h2>
<p>
<img width="520" height="299" id="Picture 3" src="JogAxes_files/image006.png">
</p>
<p>
This shows the status of the last jog request. For example,
the screen above shows an error on axis 1 because the drives are not enabled.
</p>
<p class="note">
An error will occur if a dedicated input is allocated as a jog
input because Motion Perfect is unable to change it's state.
</p>
<h2>Select Axes </h2>
<p>
<img width="520" height="346" id="Picture 5" src="JogAxes_files/image007.jpg">
</p>
<p>
This displays an axis selector box which enables the user to
select the axis to include in the jog axes display. By default, the physical
axes fitted to the controller will be displayed.
