A robot program can contain limited set of Trio BASIC
commands, related just to robot operation.
</p>
<p>
A robot BASIC program can contain all the commands of a
robot program plus other BASIC commands.

<p>
Any program of a robot type is automatically placed in a
special group in the project tree. The meaning of that group is a “Robot
project”. In other words a robot project is the set of robot programs on the
controller.

<p class="note">
The robot project is the set of programs of type “Robot Program”
and “Robot BASIC Program” which are automatically placed in a separate group in
the project tree.
</p>
<p class="note">
Robot projects are mostly managed from the Trio Robot Pendant.
</p>
<p>
Often a robot project is related to a certain robot
application. Changing (loading a new) robot project usually means changing the
robot application.
</p>
<p>
All the programs in the robot project are object of atomic
operations like “Load” “Save” (Export), etc. Most of them are available from
the robot project context menu in the project tree. (See
