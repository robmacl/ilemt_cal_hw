<h1>EtherCAT Diagnostics Wizard</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The diagnostics wizard is used for the collection of
diagnostic and debugging information and presenting it to the user in form of a
report.
</p>
<h2>Configuration page</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
To open the wizard double-click on the controller image in
the 
<a href="IntelligentDrives_EtherCAT.html">Intelligent Drives</a>
 screen.
</p>
<p>
The wizard starts with the configuration page. It contains
user interface to select devices and which information is to be collected and
added to the report.
</p>
<h3>Devices List</h3>
<p>
EtherCAT devices detected by the controller are presented to
the user as a list. The user can select from which devices the diagnostic
information will be collected. If no devices are automatically detected it is
possible to add up to 3 custom entries by using the

 button. These can be
removed later by selecting an existing custom device entry in the list and
pressing the 
<img border="0" width="17" height="17" src="EtherCAT-Diagnostics_files/image003.png">
 button.
</p>
<p>
For custom entries the user can edit their name, slave
position and configured address.

<h3>Global Sections</h3>
<p>
This list represents the following sections
from the report containing information which is not specific to a device, but
instead is global for either the controller itself or the EtherCAT module in
case of modular architectures:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
System Error – system error is retrieved
     and presented in human readable form;
</li>

 
<li>
Unit Error – unit error is retrieved and
     units in error are reported;
</li>

 
<li>
Network Configuration – EtherCAT network
     level information is displayed like the link status and the number of
     slaves attached;
</li>

 
<li>
EtherCAT Error Log – error log is
     collected as reported by ETHERCAT $d5 and $d6 functions.
</li>


</ul>
<h3>Per Slave Sections</h3>
<p>
That list represents following sections
containing information collected on per slave device basis:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
SII Configuration  - interrogate slave
     information interface via ETHERCAT $61 function;
</li>

 
<li>
ESC Configuration – interrogate ESC
     registers via ETHERCAT $31 function;
</li>

 
<li>
Synchronization – collect synchronization
     related info via ESC registers;
</li>

 
<li>
SDO Configuration – collect SDO
     information as CoE objects via ETHERCAT $41 function and requires that
     configured address is correct;
</li>

 
<li>
MDP Configuration – as CoE objects via
     ETHERCAT $41 function and requires that configured address is correct;
</li>

 
<li>
Slave Diagnosis – information contained
     in CoE $10f3 object array
</li>


</ul>
<h3>Custom Configuration</h3>
<p>
The configuration page allows using custom
configuration from an XML file in specific cases when standard configuration is
not suitable.
</p>
<h2>Information Collection Page</h2>
<p>
<img border="0" width="624" height="471" src="EtherCAT-Diagnostics_files/image005.png">
</p>
<p>
The wizard starts collecting data after
configuration has been selected. It might be a lengthy process depending on the
number of selected devices and sections. Progress is displayed on information
collection page indicating currently processed device as well as estimation of
the remaining time.
</p>
<h2>Report Page</h2>
<p>
<img border="0" width="624" height="471" src="EtherCAT-Diagnostics_files/image006.jpg">
</p>
<p>
The report page is displayed after the
information has been successfully collected. The information is presented in
hierarchical form and it is possible to collapse and expand different sections.
</p>
<p>
The report can be copied to the clipboard
or printed 
by pressing 
<img border="0" width="23" height="23" src="EtherCAT-Diagnostics_files/image007.png">
  and 
<img border="0" width="39" height="23" src="EtherCAT-Diagnostics_files/image008.png">
 buttons respectively.
</p>
<p>
 ‘Send as email’ button can be used to prepare and send the
