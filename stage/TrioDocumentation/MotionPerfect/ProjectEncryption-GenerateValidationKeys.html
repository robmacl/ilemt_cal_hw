<h1>Validation Keys</h1>
<p>
Validation keys are strings, that can be used in TrioBASIC
programs to compare against the stored User Security Code or OEM Security
Code,  for security purposes. They have the same CRC as the generated Project
Key, but are different strings.
</p>
<p>
The number of keys that need to be generated have to be
specified. 
</p>
<p>
The validation keys generation process involves 3 stages as
follows:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">

 
<li>
Enter the Project Password
</li>

 
<li>
Select  the project key type
</li>

 
<li>
Entering the corresponding security code 
</li>

 
<li>
Generating the validation keys
</li>


</ol>
<h2>Project Password</h2>
<p>
The process starts with entering the same password, that is
used for project encryption. When a project has been encrypted already and the
project encryptor main window have not been yet closed, the last user password
is remembered for user's convenience.

</p>
<h2>Selecting Validation Key Type</h2>
<p>
There are two options available:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
using User Security Code
</li>

 
<li>
using OEM Security Code
</li>


</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
When using User Security Code, the validation keys are
derived from &quot;Project Password&quot; and a custom user-supplied User
Security Code&quot;.
</p>
<p>
When using OEM Security Code, the validation keys are
derived from &quot;Project Password&quot; and a custom  OEM-supplied security
code.
</p>
<h2>Entering a security Code</h2>
<p>
Depending on the user's choice for generation of validation
keys, either a user security code, or an  OEM security code must be entered in
the text box. A Paste button is provided for convenience.
</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:28.8pt;text-indent:-28.8pt">Generating Validation Keys</h2>
<p>
The number of validation keys to be generated must be
specified. The keys are generated by pressing the “Generate” button. Keys can
be copied to clipboard, via context menu command “Copy”. This command copies
only the selected keys. If all keys are to be copied, first the context menu
“Select all” must be executed( keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A ). Keys are stored in
clipboard as text.
</p>
<p>
Keys can also be stored to a file on the disk, by pressing
the “Save To File” button. This will display a standard save dialog, where the
destination file can be specified.
