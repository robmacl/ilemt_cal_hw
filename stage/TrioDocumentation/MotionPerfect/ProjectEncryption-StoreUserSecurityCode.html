<h1>Storing a User Security Code</h1>
<p>
When User Security Code feature is enabled on the Motion
Coordinator,  users can set a custom security code, that is stored on the
Motion Coordinator. This security code takes place together with the project
key, when loading an encrypted project, in order to decrypt the project on the 
<i>Motion</i>
Coordinator.
</p>
<p>
The validation keys generation process involves 2 stages as
follows:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">

 
<li>
Entering a Feature Enable Code
</li>

 
<li>
Entering the custom security code
</li>


</ol>
<h2>Entering a Feature Enable Code</h2>
<p>
Since storing a user security code is a controller soft
feature, a corresponding feature enable code must be specified. It is validated
once the store operation is initiated. Invalid feature codes lock the
controller and it  has to be cycle powered.

<h2>Entering a user security code</h2>
<p>
A custom user security code has to be entered in the text
box. A Paste button is provided for convenience. Security code is stored by
pressing the “Store” button.
