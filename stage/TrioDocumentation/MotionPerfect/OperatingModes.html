<h1>Operating Modes</h1>
<p>
<i>Motion</i> Perfect has four operating modes:
</p>
<ul style="list_style_type:disc">
<li class="indent-list-first">
Disconnected
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
Direct
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
Tool Mode
</li>
<li class="indent-list-last">
Sync Mode
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current connection mode is displayed on the right of the
status bar at the bottom of 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect's main window.
</p>
<h2><img width="24" height="24" id="Picture 1" src="OperatingModes_files/image001.png">
 Disconnected</h2>
<p>
Not connected to a controller. All tools are closed and no
communications ports are open.
</p>
<h2><img width="24" height="24" id="Picture 2" src="OperatingModes_files/image002.png">
 Direct Mode</h2>
<p>
A direct connection is made to a controller allowing a
Terminal tool to be used for direct interaction with the command line on the
controller.
</p>
<h2><img width="24" height="24" id="Picture 4" src="OperatingModes_files/image003.png">
 Tool Mode</h2>
<p>
A multichannel connection is made to a controller allowing
the monitoring tools within 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect to be used. This mode allows
the user to see a list of the programs on the controller (so that they can be
started and stopped) but does not allow editing of any of the programs.
</p>
<h2><img width="24" height="24" id="Picture 3" src="OperatingModes_files/image004.png">
 Sync Mode</h2>
<p>
A multichannel connection is made to a controller and a
local project on the PC is opened. The contents of the controller and the
project are synchronized so that the local copy of all programs matches those
on the controller.  All of 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect’s tools are available and
programs can be edited. The synchronization process can involve deleting
programs or copying them from the controller to the PC of vice versa.
</p>
<p class="note">
A connection (direct or multichannel) to a controller consists of
a single TCP/IP socket connection over Ethernet.
