<h1>Modify STARTUP Program</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The software provides functionality in form of a wizard to
automate modifications of the STARTUP program. The result of the operation of
the wizard is one or more automatically generated sections. Each section
contains a list of drive parameters to be set.
</p>
<p>
For EtherCAT devices the STARTUP program section contains a
list of CoE objects that are writable in the operational state and their values
can be changed without power-cycling the device.
</p>
<h2>Device Selection Page</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The device selection page is common for all
intelligent device types. A list of all detected devices is displayed and the
user can select which ones to add to the STARTUP program.
</p>
<p>
If no intelligent devices from given type
are selected for processing, the corresponding section in STARTUP file will not
be processed and its content will remain the same.
</p>
<h2>CoE Object Selection Page - Per Device Model</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Selected EtherCAT devices are grouped by
their model. For each group of devices a selection page is displayed. This
simplifies the CoE object selection procedure on a system with several devices
of a same model. As the selection of CoE object is made for multiple devices at
once it is possible for the corresponding check-boxes to have 3 states:
</p>
<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
checked 
<img width="12" height="12" src="EtherCAT-ModifyStartup_files/image009.png" alt="*">
 when the CoE
     object is selected for all devices in the group;
</li>

 
<li>
semi-checked 
<img width="12" height="12" src="EtherCAT-ModifyStartup_files/image010.png" alt="*">
 when the CoE
     object is selected for some of the devices but not for all. That
     configuration is possible when custom selection is made for each device
     individually;
</li>

 
<li>
unchecked 
<img width="12" height="12" src="EtherCAT-ModifyStartup_files/image011.png">
 when the CoE object is
     not selected for store for any device.
</li>


</ul>
<p>
Press ‘Select All’ button to select all
writable parameters for storing.
</p>
<p>
Press ‘Select None’ button to select that no
parameter will be stored for this drive model.
</p>
<p>
Disabled lines in the list represent CoE
objects that are either read-only or not writable in the operational state.
</p>
<h3>Configuring the List of CoE Objects</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It is possible to customize the list of CoE
objects by pressing ‘Configure list…’ button. The displayed user interface is
the same as the one for configuring CoE object list in EtherCAT device info
tool window. By default a dedicated category “STARTUP Objects” is created so
that categories used by device info tool are not changed.
</p>
<h2>Selection Summary Page</h2>
<p>
<img width="601" height="450" src="EtherCAT-ModifyStartup_files/image013.jpg">
</p>
<p>
The selection summary page is displayed
once CoE object selections have been made for all EtherCAT devices. The values
of selected objects are collected and displayed as well.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to customize CoE object
selection for individual devices by clicking ‘Customize’ button next to device
description. When this button is clicked the user is again presented with the CoE
object selection page but allowing adjustments only for that particular device.
</p>
<p>
The EtherCAT STARTUP program section
specific parameters, such as the VR used for data transfer and the channel for
warning and error messages, can be adjusted on this page.
</p>
<h2>STARTUP Program Modification Page</h2>
<p>
<img width="601" height="450" src="EtherCAT-ModifyStartup_files/image014.jpg">
</p>
<p>
The final confirmation page is displayed
once the CoE object selection has been finalized and all values have been
collected. 
</p>
<p>
By pressing ‘Modify’ button all accumulated
data will be written to corresponding sections of the STARTUP program.
</p>
<p>
Press ‘Exit’ button to finish the wizard
without doing any modifications to the STARTUP program.
