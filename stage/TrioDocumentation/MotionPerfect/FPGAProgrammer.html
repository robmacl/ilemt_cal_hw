<h1>FPGA Programmer Tool</h1>
<p>
The FPGA Programmer tool allows the user to reprogram the FPGA
in the controller. Using this tool it is possible to upgrade the FPGA code
without having to return the controller to Trio. This functionality is not
supported by all controllers.
</p>
<h2>Using the Tool</h2>
<p>
The tool is implemented as a Wizard which guides the user
through the programming process. The tool is started by selecting “Controller /
Reprogram FPGA…” the Motion Perfect’s main menu. The stages of the process are
as follows:
</p>
<h3>Select FPGA program version to install</h3>

</p>
<p>
The current FPGA version and the versions available are
displayed. The user should choose the correct version to install from the
combo-box then press “Next” to continue.
</p>
<h3>Confirm the reprogramming operation</h3>
<p>

<p>
A warning message is displayed. If you are happy with this
then press “Reprogram” to continue.
</p>
<h3>Reprogram</h3>

</p>
<p>
A warning message is displayed and a progress bar is used to
indicate that something is happening. Motion Perfect cannot display actual
progress because the information is not available to it. When programming is
complete the user is prompted to cycle controller power and then reconnect.

Cycle controller power, wait for the controller to restart
then press the “Reconnect” button.
