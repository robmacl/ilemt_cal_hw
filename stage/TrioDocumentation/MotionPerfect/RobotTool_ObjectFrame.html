<h1>Object Frames</h1>
<p>
The object frame is a transformation
between the global coordinate system and the coordinate system of an object
that is manipulated by the robot. By using object frames it is possible for
target points to be defined with respect in the coordinate system of the
object. Similar to the target points it is presented as a set of 6 values:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>X, Y, Z – for the coordinates of the offset in
millimeters
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>U, V, W – for the angular orientation of in
degrees.
</p>
<p>
An array of 31 object frame definitions is
available for use to all programs. A unique name can be assigned to each object
frame to be used to identify and reference it in programs. 
</p>
<p>
The robot tool displays a list of already defined
object frames.

<h2>Object Frame Constructor</h2>
<p>
The object frame can be constructed using a
wizard provided by the robot tool. There are two modes of operation: 
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Using single point – to define the frame as a
translation only
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Using three points – in which case translation
as well an orientation can be calculated.
</p>
<h3>Single Point Mode</h3>
<p>
In that mode the operator takes a single
point which defines the base or the origin of the object coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
<img width="376" height="540" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image002.png">
</p>
<p>
The point is captured using the robot jog
tool user interface.
</p>
<p>
<img width="593" height="468" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image003.png">
</p>
<p>
The operator should adjust the robot
position and orientation until the tip goes as close as possible to the origin
of object coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
Pressing the ‘Capture’ button accepts the
point and closes the robot jog tool.
</p>
<p>
The corresponding button changes its state
and displays the coordinates of the captured point.
</p>
<p>
<img width="376" height="540" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image004.png">
</p>
<p>
The object frame is now ready to be stored
and the operator can select a unique name for it so that it can be referenced
in programs.
</p>
<p>
Pressing ‘Done’ button stores the object
frame on the controller.
</p>
<h3>Three Points Mode</h3>
<p>
In this mode the operator has to capture
three points as follows:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First point should be at the base or the origin
of the object coordinate system;
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Second point should on the X axis of the object
coordinate system;
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
-
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Third point should on the Y axis of the object
coordinate system. 
</p>
<p>
<img width="376" height="724" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image005.png">
</p>
<p>
Points are captured using the robot jog tool window.
</p>
<p>
The operator should adjust the robot
position and orientation until the tip goes as close as possible to the desired
target point.
</p>
<p>
Pressing the appropriate ‘Capture’ button
accepts the point and closes the robot jog tool.
</p>
<p>
The corresponding button changes its state
and displays the coordinates of the captured point.
</p>
<p>
<img width="376" height="724" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image006.png">
</p>
<p>
When three points are captured the object
frame is ready to be stored and the operator can select a unique name for it so
that it can be referenced in programs.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to select the alignment
axis to be +X or +Y. That allows the operator to select which of these two axes
is captured more accurately and should take precedence in calculations.
</p>
<p>
Pressing the ‘Done’ button stores the
object frame on the controller.
</p>
<h2>Modifying Object Frame</h2>
<p>
By pressing 
<img width="29" height="26" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image007.png">
 button the operator can directly type-in a new object frame or
modify the coordinates or the name of a previously defined entry. That is
particularly useful when the orientation of the object frame needs to be
adjusted.
</p>
<p>
<img width="206" height="244" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image008.png">
</p>
<p>
Pressing the ‘Apply’ button stores the
changes on the controller.
</p>
<h2>Deleting an Object Frame</h2>
<p>
By pressing 
<img width="25" height="25" src="RobotTool_ObjectFrame_files/image009.png">
button the data stored in selected object frame entries will be
deleted and they will become empty.
