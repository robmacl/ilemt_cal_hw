The &quot;Backup Manager&quot; is used to manage the backups
both automatically created before and after every synchronization operation and
manually created by the user. The backup contents pane shows the contents of
the backup selected in the Backup List.
</p>
<h2>Automatic Backups</h2>
<p>
Every time 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect performs a synchronization
two automatic backups of the project are made, one before and one after.
Because of this the number of automatic backups retained is limited so as not
to use excessive disk space.
</p>
<h2>Manual Backups</h2>
<p>
The user can create a backup manually at any time by
clicking on the &quot;Create Backup&quot; button. The number of manually
created backups is not limited.
</p>
<h2>Reverting</h2>
<p>
To revert the project back to a given backup; Select the
backup and click on the &quot;Revert to Selected Backup&quot; button.
</p>
<h2>Manually Deleting Backups</h2>
<p>
Backups can be deleted manually by selecting them in the
backup list then clicking on the &quot;Delete Selected&quot;, or &quot;Delete
Older&quot; button.
</p>
<h2>Archive</h2>
<p>
The &quot;Archive&quot; button save the selected backup as a
ZIP archive. This is useful if the project needs to be sent to Trio for support
or to another user.
