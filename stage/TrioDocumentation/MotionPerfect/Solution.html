<h1>Solutions</h1>
<p>
In order to handle systems which contain more than one
controller 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect uses a &quot;Solution&quot; to manage the
connections to more than one controller and their associated projects. The
solution defines a list of controllers included in the solution. For each
controller it also defines a connection used to communicate with the controller
and a project associated with it. No two controllers can be associated with the
same project. The user can create and edit a solution using the 
<a href="SolutionManager.html">Solution Manager</a>
.
</p>
<p>
When a single project is opened in 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect a
default solution is used and is largely transparent to the user.
