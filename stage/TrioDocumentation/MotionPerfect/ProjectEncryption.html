<h1>Project Encryption</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<i>Motion</i> Perfect 3 Project Encryptor is a tool that can
be run both as a standalone application, and from within 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect
3 itself. It encrypts one or more programs in a 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect 3 project
so that the TrioBASIC/IEC 61131-3 source for that program cannot be read. This
gives solution providers a way of protecting their work from possible reverse
engineering attempts by third parties.
</p>
<h2>Encryption Process</h2>
<p>
The encryption process uses a &quot;Project Password&quot;
together with a security code to encrypt one or more Trio BASIC programs in a
project. For &quot;encrypted&quot; IEC 61131-3 tasks, the source code is
removed, and only the executable image remains in the encrypted project. The
encryption of other types of programs or files is not supported.
</p>
<p>
The encryption process creates a new project leaving the
original unencrypted project intact. When the encrypted version of a project is
loaded onto a 
<i>Motion</i> Coordinator a &quot;Project Key&quot; is required
to enable the decryption of the encrypted programs. This key, which is
generated by the encryption tool, is used by the 
<i>Motion</i> Coordinator to
decrypt the Trio BASIC programs for compilation and running.
</p>
<p>
The decryption &quot;Project Key&quot;, can be generated
from the &quot;Project Password&quot; and one of:
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
1.
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
security code of the target 
<i>Motion</i> Coordinator and is unique to that 
<i>Motion</i>
Coordinator, being derived from its serial number and an in-built hardware
identification.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
2.
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a
custom user security code, set by the user.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt">
3.
<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an
OEM security code set by the equipment manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
The process uses a wizard-like user interface, which guides
the user through the process step by step.
</p>
<h2>Project Encryptor Tool</h2>
<p>
The project encryptor tool can be started from within 
<i>Motion</i>
Perfect by selecting &quot;Project/Manage Encryption&quot; from the main men.

<ul type="disc">

 
<li>
<b>Encrypt Project </b>starts the 
<a href="ProjectEncryption-EncryptProject.html">project encryption</a>
 wizard
</li>

 
<li>
<b>Generate Project Key</b> starts the 
<a href="ProjectEncryption-GenerateProjectKey.html">project key generation</a>

     wizard
</li>

 
<li>
<b>Generate Validation Keys</b> starts the 
<a href="ProjectEncryption-GenerateValidationKeys.html">validation keys
     generation</a>
 wizard
</li>

 
<li>
<b>Store User Security Code</b> starts the wizard for 
<a href="ProjectEncryption-StoreUserSecurityCode.html">storing a user
     security code</a>
 on the Motion Coordinator. This option is not available
     when running as a standalone application, or when Motion Perfect is not
     connected to a Motion Coordinator.
