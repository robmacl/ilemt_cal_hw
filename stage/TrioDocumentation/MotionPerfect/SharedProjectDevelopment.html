<h1>Shared Project Development</h1>
<p>
In some circumstances multiple developers may need to work
on a same project. Motion Perfect provides some facilities towards that.

<h2>Working without content protection</h2>

</p>
<p>
This is the case when the project programs are available to
all developers. No programs need to be protected. A source control system which
best covers the needs can be used for code management and version tracking.

<h2>Working with content protection</h2>
<p>
<img width="350" height="337" id="Picture 1" src="SharedProjectDevelopment_files/image002.png">
</p>
<p>
This is the case when developer is only responsible for a
part of the project. All the other parts (programs) of the project are
protected and cannot be viewed nor modified. Each developer provides his/her
work in a form of package (see the related topics for more information).
Exchanging packages is possible along with corresponding keys (project keys) in
the same manner as working with encrypted programs. Usually a key for a package
is provided only once to each user of the package (co-worker). Following updates
(package versions) are expected to use same key which Motion Perfect can be
made to remember.
