<h1>EtherCAT Drive Motor Info</h1>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>Device Info</h2>
<p>
Motor model number connected to the drive 
</p>
<h2>Control Flags</h2>
<p>
The EtherCAT control word sent to the drive from the
controller.  The control word is a 16-bit value which controls the operation of
the drive; enable, disable, reset fault, etc.  Each bit of the 16-bit word is
shown as an LED with the meaning (where appropriate).  The control word value
is internally generated by the contorller, this view is read-only for
diagnostic purposes. 
</p>
<h2>Status Flags</h2>
<p>
The EtherCAT status word sent to the controller from the
drive.  The status word is a 16-bit value which shows the status of the drive;
enabled, disabled, in fault.  Each bit of the 16-bit word is shown as an LED
with the meaning (where appropriate).  The status word is a read only value
which is generated by the drive, this view is generally for diagnostic
purposes.
</p>
<p>
The ‘Fault’ indicator is the only indicator to show red
rather than green.  If this is illuminated the ‘Fault Reset’ button is
enabled.  Clicking this button will force the controller to perform a fault
reset action on the drive.  N.B. This will only clear the fault on the drive,
not any associated error generated on the controller.
</p>
<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>
The movement panel shows positional data in units
transmitted over the EtherCAT network.
</p>
<p>
The Drive data is only populated if the data is included in
the EtherCAT profile which can be configured using the 
<a href="EtherCAT-Device-NetworkConfiguration.html">Network Configuration</a>

screen.  If the data is not mapped the value will be zero.  
</p>
<p>
For the Drive values; position shows ENCODER, velocity shows
DRIVE_VELOCITY, torque shows DRIVE_TORQUE.
</p>
<h2>Encoder</h2>
<p>
Details about the encoder connected is shown in the encoder
panel.  The type is either Absolute or Incremental.  Incremental encoder can
represents the encoder position within one revolution (single-turn
resolution).  Absolute encoders can additioanlly represent the a position
across multiple revolutions (multi-turn resolution), but need a battery to
maintain position.
