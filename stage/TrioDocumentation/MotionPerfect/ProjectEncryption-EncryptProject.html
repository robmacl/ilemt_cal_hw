<h1>Encrypting a Project</h1>
<p>
The project encryption process involves several stages as
follows:
</p>
<ol style="list_style_type:decimal">
<li class="indent-list-first">
Enter
the Project Password
</li>
<li class="indent-list-middle">
Select 
the project to be encrypted
</li>
<li class="indent-list-last">
Select
where the encrypted project is to be stored
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Project Password</h2>
<p>
The encryption process starts with entering a project
password. The password is used for encrypting the programs in a project.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The password needs to be entered twice to reduce the chance
of an entry error occurring. For security reasons the password is not displayed
in the applications window.
</p>
<h2>Selecting the Source Project</h2>
<p>
The user must select the project to be encrypted (source
project).When Project Encryptor is started from within Motion Perfect, and
connection mode is Sync mode, the source project is automatically set to the
project that Motion Perfect is synchronized with.

Selecting the
programs to be encrypted</h2>
<p>
To select which programs to encrypt tick the check boxes
next to the program names
</p>
<p>
If a program is not encryptable the entry in the program
list will be greyed out and it will not be possible to check it.
</p>
<h2>Selecting the Destination Project</h2>
<p>
The destination project (which must be different from the
source project) is selected by using the &quot;Browse&quot; button and the
standard project browse dialog.
</p>

</p>
<h2>Completing the procedure</h2>
<p>
After the project has been encrypted, the wizard provides
options to encrypt another project, to close the dialog and load the encrypted
project inside Motion Perfect, or simply close the dialog.
