<h1>Connecting to a Controller</h1>
<p>
Firstly a physical connection needs to be made between the
PC and the controller. Normally this will be an Ethernet connection, either
directly or over a network. Other types of connection are available for special
purposes (such as firmware loading) or for direct connections to older
controllers.
</p>
<p>
When 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect is first run it will go through
more stages to make a connection as it normally remembers previous connection
settings. See “
<a href="InitialConnection.html">Initial Connection</a>
” for
details.
</p>
<p>
Connecting 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect to a controller is normally
a two stage process:
</p>
<ol style="list_style_type:decimal">
<li class="indent-list-first">
Specify
a set of communications parameters.
</li>
<li class="indent-list-last">
Set
an 
<a href="OperatingModes.html">operating mode</a>
.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<i>Motion </i>Perfect remembers the settings for its last
connection and uses these as defaults for the next connection.
</p>
<h2>Communications Parameters</h2>
<p>
To specify the communications parameters select “
<a href="MainMenu.html#Controller">Controller</a>
 / Connection Settings” from 
<i>Motion</i>
Perfect’s main menu or click on the connection settings indicator in the status
bar.
</p>
<p>
This will open the “
<a href="ConnectionDialog.html">Connection
dialog</a>
”.  The appearance of the dialog is different depending on which
interface has been selected.
</p>
<p>
First select the interface required and then the parameters.

</p>
<p>
To make a connection to a controller select an operating
mode other than “Disconnected” from the “Controller” entry in the main menu or
from the mode selector at the right end of the status bar at the bottom of the 
<i>Motion</i>
Perfect main window.
</p>
<p>
Closing the dialog with “Apply” will update the current
connection communication parameters. Closing it with “Apply and Connect” will
update the current communications parameters and connect to the controller
using the last used connection operating mode.
</p>
<h2>Operating Mode</h2>
<p>
Select an 
<a href="OperatingModes.html">operating mode</a>

from the “
<a href="MainMenu.html#Controller">Controller</a>
” section of the
main menu or from the mode indicator in the status bar. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Motion</i> Perfect will then try to connect to the
controller using the selected operating mode and the previously selected
communications parameters.
</p>
<h3>Project</h3>
<p>
If “Sync mode” was selected 
<i>Motion</i> Perfect will try
and synchronize the contents of the controller with the last used project. If
the controller model is the same as the previously connected controller the
project is automatically selected, if the controller model is different a
dialog is displayed to allow the user to choose between modifying the project and
cancelling the connect operation.

</p>
<p>
If the user cancels then connection in “Tool Mode” is
attempted.
</p>
<p>
After cancelling the user can select a suitable option from
the “
<a href="MainMenu.html#Project">Project</a>
” section of the main menu as
needed.
